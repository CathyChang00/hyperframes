# Hyperframes

Open-source video rendering framework: write HTML, render video.

```
packages/
  cli/       → hyperframes CLI (create, preview, lint, render)
  core/      → Types, parsers, generators, linter, runtime, frame adapters
  engine/    → Seekable page-to-video capture engine (Puppeteer + FFmpeg)
  player/    → Embeddable <hyperframes-player> web component
  producer/  → Full rendering pipeline (capture + encode + audio mix)
  studio/    → Browser-based composition editor UI
```

## Development

```bash
bun install     # Install dependencies
bun run build   # Build all packages
bun run test    # Run tests
```

**This repo uses bun**, not pnpm. Do NOT run `pnpm install` — it creates a `pnpm-lock.yaml` that should not exist. Workspace linking relies on bun's resolution from `"workspaces"` in root `package.json`.

### Linting & Formatting

This project uses **oxlint** and **oxfmt** (not biome, not eslint, not prettier).

```bash
bunx oxlint <files>        # Lint
bunx oxfmt <files>         # Format (write)
bunx oxfmt --check <files> # Format (check only, used by pre-commit hook)
```

Always run both on changed files before committing. The lefthook pre-commit hook runs `bunx oxlint` and `bunx oxfmt --check` automatically.

### Adding CLI Commands

When adding a new CLI command:

1. Define the command in `packages/cli/src/commands/<name>.ts` using `defineCommand` from citty
2. **Export `examples`** in the same file — `export const examples: Example[] = [...]` (import `Example` from `./_examples.js`). These are displayed by `--help`.
3. Register it in `packages/cli/src/cli.ts` under `subCommands` (lazy-loaded)
4. **Add to help groups** in `packages/cli/src/help.ts` — add the command name and description to the appropriate `GROUPS` entry. Without this, the command won't appear in `hyperframes --help` even though it works.
5. **Document it** in `docs/packages/cli.mdx` — add a section with usage examples and flags.
6. Validate by running `npx tsx packages/cli/src/cli.ts --help` (command appears in the list) and `npx tsx packages/cli/src/cli.ts <name> --help` (examples appear).

### Regression Test Golden Baselines (producer)

`packages/producer/tests/<name>/output/output.mp4` baselines MUST be generated
inside `Dockerfile.test`, not on your host. CI renders inside that Docker image
with a specific Chrome + ffmpeg build; pixel-level output drifts across
different host Chrome/ffmpeg versions and will fail PSNR at dozens of
checkpoints even when the code is correct.

```bash
# Build the test image once:
docker build -t hyperframes-producer:test -f Dockerfile.test .

# Generate or update a baseline (runs the harness with --update inside Docker):
bun run --cwd packages/producer docker:test:update <test-name>
```

Never run `bun run --cwd packages/producer test:update` directly from the
host to capture a baseline that will be committed — the resulting output.mp4
will not match CI. Use it only for local-only experimentation.

## Skills

Composition authoring (not repo development) is guided by skills installed via `npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes`. See `skills/` for source. The active skills are:

- `/video-workflows` (router) — First stop for any video-creation intent ("make me a video", "promo for X", "launch video", "explainer", "tutorial", etc.). Maps the request to the right workflow via an INPUT × OUTPUT-length decision table, asks clarifying questions when intent is under-specified, and refuses to fake-route when no matching workflow exists. **Use BEFORE invoking a specific workflow.**
- `/hyperframes-core` — HTML composition contract: data attributes, clips, tracks, sub-compositions, variables, media playback, deterministic render rules, and validation of minimal renderable projects.
- `/hyperframes-creative` — Non-animation creative direction: `design.md` handling, palettes, typography, narration, beat planning, audio-reactive, composition patterns. For atomic motion patterns and scene blueprints use `/hyperframes-animation`.
- `/hyperframes-animation` — All motion knowledge in one skill: atomic rules (`rules-index.md`), multi-phase scene blueprints (`blueprints-index.md`), scene transitions (`transitions/`), broader motion-design techniques (`techniques.md`), runtime adapters (`adapters/{gsap,lottie,three,animejs,css-animations,waapi,typegpu}.md`), and animation-map analysis (`scripts/animation-map.mjs`). GSAP is the default; other runtimes loaded on demand from `adapters/`.
- `/product-launch-video` — End-to-end orchestrator: URL → 60-90s product launch / SaaS explainer / promo video (also accepts a pre-written script / text brief in no-capture mode). Routed to by `/video-workflows`. For pure-text explainers with no product URL or real screenshots, use `/faceless-explainer` instead.
- `/faceless-explainer` — End-to-end orchestrator: arbitrary text (article / notes / topic / brief — **no URL, no website capture**) → 60-90s faceless explainer video. Every visual is LLM-invented (typography / abstract graphics / diagram / data-viz), chosen per scene by content; ships the `pin-and-paper` style preset. Forked from `/product-launch-video`; routed to by `/video-workflows`.
- `/hyperframes-cli` — CLI dev loop: `init`, `lint`, `validate`, `inspect`, `preview`, `render`, `doctor`, `browser`, `info`, `upgrade`, `compositions`, `docs`, `benchmark`, and environment troubleshooting.
- `/hyperframes-registry` — Installing registry blocks and components via `hyperframes add`, wiring them into `index.html`, and working with `hyperframes.json`.
- `/hyperframes-media` — Asset preprocessing (`tts` / `transcribe` / `remove-background`) plus caption authoring — subtitles, lyrics, karaoke, per-word styling, transcript JSON/SRT/VTT import, timing from audio. Captions live with the asset they consume.

Tailwind v4 projects (`hyperframes init --tailwind`): see `/hyperframes-core` → `references/tailwind.md`.
